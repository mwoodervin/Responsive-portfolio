        <p>I am an independent consultant specializing in small business development, management and systems improvement.</p> 
          
        <p>I have a background in finance and am currently two-thirds of the way through a 6-month coding bootcamp, working toward a certificate in full-stack web development.</p>
        
        <p>Prior to becoming an independent consultant, I worked in municipal finance, providing financial advising and data analysis for states and state agencies.  
          I also spent over 10 years working in various facets of social services, including advocating for children in the foster care and adoption system in New York City; running a community residence for 
          adults with mental health and addiction issues; and co-directing an employment project for adults with developmental disabilities.</p>

        <p>I have served on several school and community boards and I was a founding board member of Catamount Womenaid, a community-based organization dedicated to providing short-term grant funding for families in need.</p>
      
        <p>I graduated from Magna Cum Laude from Hamilton College and hold an MBA with a concentration in Finance from the University at Albany.  I am living in Stratham, NH with my two sons.
          My spare time is spent outdoors as much as possible!</p>
